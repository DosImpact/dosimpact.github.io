something negative\n\nthat was work related happened to you?\n\nPerhaps it was a setback, or perhaps you were let go.\n\nYou know, I was let go years ago,\n\nand at the time I was unhappy.\n\nBut years later I looked back and thought thank you, God.\n\nYou know, thank God, or whatever, that that happened to me,\n\nbecause it kinda forced me to focus\n\non what I'm most passionate about.\n\nOkay.\n\nAlright, so, remember when that awful thing\n\nhappened to you at work, whatever that might be.\n\nRight, remember how awful you felt at the time, alright.\n\nThen I want you to remember how years later,\n\nwhen you looked back at that moment,\n\nyou reflected how you were happy\n\nand grateful that that event occurred to you, okay.\n\nIn fact, you're even happier now than before you\n\nwere let go, or before whatever negative thing\n\nhappened to you at work, within reason of course.\n\nYou're happy it happened\n\nbecause you weren't passionate about that job anyway.\n\nOkay, now, perception becomes reality,\n\nand we must become or get inspired by our thoughts.\n\nWe really need to change the lens by which we see the world.\n\nI love that saying.\n\nAnd so when something negative happens to you,\n\nwithin reason, we need to see the positives\n\nin almost every event that occurs professionally to us.\n\nAnd the great tennis player Roger Federer once said\n\n\"I'm a very positive thinker, and I think that\n\n\"is what makes me do well\n\n\"in the most difficult moments in my life.\"\n\nAlways see the positive, right.\n\nThere's that old Monty Python movie\n\nAlways Look on the Bright Side of Life.\n\nI won't go there.\n\nOkay, so you see crisis often leads to opportunity.\n\nRight, from now on that's what you'll see.\n\nYou see a crisis, it's gonna lead to opportunity.\n\nA crisis can be a positive event\n\nif you choose to see it that way, as your competitors won't.\n\nRemember, we gotta change the lens\n\nby which we see the world.\n\nAnd so the most successful people\n\nthat I know in life have that attitude, okay.\n\nThey're so positive and they think\n\nthat they can do literally anything\n\nwhen they are in a negative situation.\n\nAnd so I read a Dr. Seuss book\n\nto my kids the other day, and I love some of his quotes.\n\nI mean, he creates these books for kids,\n\nbut he was very cerebral, right.\n\nVery out there, but in kind of a cool,\n\nSalvador Dali author authentic style.\n\nOkay, so Dr. Seuss said this:\n\n\"Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.\"\n\nAn example of this is to Richard Branson,\n\nwho is probably the most positive,\n\nhas the most positive attitude of anybody out there.\n\nRight, he thinks he can do anything,\n\nand the people that work with him can do anything.\n\nRight, he inspires his employees to be the same way.\n\nAnd I don't know if you've ever flown\n\nVirgin Atlantic or Virgin America,\n\nbut you know what I mean if you have, right?\n\nEvery single employee is positive, ya know.\n\nA positive attitude is really, really contagious, okay.\n\nAnd so I love hanging out with inspiring, positive people.\n\nI love watching incredibly inspiring TED Talks\n\nor TEDx Talks.\n\nI love reading inspiring biographies\n\nof really positive people.\n\nAnd so from now on, let's see most events\n\nin our life as positive, within reason.\n\nSo I love this quote from Helen Keller:\n\n\"Keep your face to the sunshine\n\n\"and you just cannot ever see a shadow if you do that.\"\n\nAmazing.\n\nOkay, moving on to today's exercise.\n\nPlease think of three events that occurred\n\nto you in the past that you thought were negative events\n\nbut ended up being blessings in hindsight.\n\nOkay, I'll see you on Day 7 tomorrow.\n\nThank you.\n")))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
