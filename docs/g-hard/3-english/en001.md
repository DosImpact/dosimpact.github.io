```

(upbeat rock music)

Welcome to Day 6: Crisis Becomes Opportunity.

(moves into light peaceful music)

Remember when something negative

that was work related happened to you?

Perhaps it was a setback, or perhaps you were let go.

You know, I was let go years ago,

and at the time I was unhappy.

But years later I looked back and thought thank you, God.

You know, thank God, or whatever, that that happened to me,

because it kinda forced me to focus

on what I'm most passionate about.

Okay.

Alright, so, remember when that awful thing

happened to you at work, whatever that might be.

Right, remember how awful you felt at the time, alright.

Then I want you to remember how years later,

when you looked back at that moment,

you reflected how you were happy

and grateful that that event occurred to you, okay.

In fact, you're even happier now than before you

were let go, or before whatever negative thing

happened to you at work, within reason of course.

You're happy it happened

because you weren't passionate about that job anyway.

Okay, now, perception becomes reality,

and we must become or get inspired by our thoughts.

We really need to change the lens by which we see the world.

I love that saying.

And so when something negative happens to you,

within reason, we need to see the positives

in almost every event that occurs professionally to us.

And the great tennis player Roger Federer once said

"I'm a very positive thinker, and I think that

"is what makes me do well

"in the most difficult moments in my life."

Always see the positive, right.

There's that old Monty Python movie

Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.

I won't go there.

Okay, so you see crisis often leads to opportunity.

Right, from now on that's what you'll see.

You see a crisis, it's gonna lead to opportunity.

A crisis can be a positive event

if you choose to see it that way, as your competitors won't.

Remember, we gotta change the lens

by which we see the world.

And so the most successful people

that I know in life have that attitude, okay.

They're so positive and they think

that they can do literally anything

when they are in a negative situation.

And so I read a Dr. Seuss book

to my kids the other day, and I love some of his quotes.

I mean, he creates these books for kids,

but he was very cerebral, right.

Very out there, but in kind of a cool,

Salvador Dali author authentic style.

Okay, so Dr. Seuss said this:

"Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened."

An example of this is to Richard Branson,

who is probably the most positive,

has the most positive attitude of anybody out there.

Right, he thinks he can do anything,

and the people that work with him can do anything.

Right, he inspires his employees to be the same way.

And I don't know if you've ever flown

Virgin Atlantic or Virgin America,

but you know what I mean if you have, right?

Every single employee is positive, ya know.

A positive attitude is really, really contagious, okay.

And so I love hanging out with inspiring, positive people.

I love watching incredibly inspiring TED Talks

or TEDx Talks.

I love reading inspiring biographies

of really positive people.

And so from now on, let's see most events

in our life as positive, within reason.

So I love this quote from Helen Keller:

"Keep your face to the sunshine

"and you just cannot ever see a shadow if you do that."

Amazing.

Okay, moving on to today's exercise.

Please think of three events that occurred

to you in the past that you thought were negative events

but ended up being blessings in hindsight.

Okay, I'll see you on Day 7 tomorrow.

Thank you.
